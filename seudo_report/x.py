def discretize(state):
    return cell



# known state and goal, but we avoid using heuristic
# discretize the continuous space, called cells

# In SoRB, a goal-conditioned value function provides edge weights, and nodes are taken to be previously seen observations in a replay buffer


# Try Restoring simulator state is a highly efficient method for returning to previously visited states?
